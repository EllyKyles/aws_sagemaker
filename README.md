UFO Sightings Algorithms Lab
The goal of this notebook is to build out models to use for predicting the legitimacy of a UFO sighting using the XGBoost and Linear Learner algorithm.

1. Load dataset onto Notebook instance memory from S3

2. Cleaning, transforming, analyize, and preparing the dataset

3. Create and train our model (XGBoost))

4. Create and train our model (Linear Learner))

Data used for this analysis can be found: https://ml-lab-ufo-elly.s3.amazonaws.com/ufo_dataset/ufodata.csv
